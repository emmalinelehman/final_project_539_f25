        <p class="stage-description">
          The journey begins under the endless summer sun of the Arctic tundra.
          Here, amidst blooming wildflowers and rocky outcrops, the terns court, nest,
          and raise their young in the safety of the 24-hour daylight. It is a time of
          abundance, preparing the next generation for the monumental flight ahead.

    <!-- Stage 2: North Atlantic Departure -->

        <h2 class="stage-title">North Atlantic Departure</h2>
        <p class="stage-description">
          As the polar light fades and the days grow shorter, the terns lift from their
          nesting grounds. They gather in great flocks, their calls echoing against the
          cliffs, before embarking on their southward flight across the turbulent
          North Atlantic, leaving the solid earth behind for the open sky.

        <h2 class="stage-title">Mid-Atlantic Crossing</h2>
        <p class="stage-description">
          Over deep blue waters, the Arctic Tern travels thousands of miles—one of the
          longest continuous flights of any creature on Earth. They glide effortlessly
          on ocean breezes, dipping to the surface to snatch small fish, barely
          expending energy as they traverse the vast, featureless horizon.

        <h2 class="stage-title">Southern Ocean Passage</h2>
        <p class="stage-description">
          Guided by ancient instincts, ocean currents, and trade winds, the terns
          navigate the roaring forties and furious fifties. They glide along the
          edges of continents, using the powerful westerlies to propel them
          toward the icy, nutrient-rich waters of the southern seas.

        <h2 class="stage-title">Antarctic Feeding Grounds</h2>
        <p class="stage-description">
          Endless daylight returns as the terns reach the Antarctic pack ice.
          Here, they molt and feast on krill in the cold violet glow of the
          southern summer, enjoying a second summer in a single year—the only
          animal on Earth to see more daylight than any other.

        <h2 class="stage-title">Return North</h2>
        <p class="stage-description">
          As the Antarctic winter approaches, the Arctic Tern traces its S-shaped
          path north again. Battling headwinds and storms, they complete a
          staggering 44,000-mile round trip, returning to the Arctic just as the
          snow melts, ready to begin the cycle of life anew.
